<h1>Killone Group Water Scheme – FAQ</h1>
<p style="text-align:center; max-width:700px; margin:auto;">
  Welcome to the Killone Group Water Scheme FAQ. Here you will find some answers to the most common questions about our scheme, how we operate, and how we keep your water flowing safely and reliably.
</p>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>1. What is a group water scheme?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>A group water scheme (GWS) is a community-run organisation that supplies water to homes and farms, particularly in rural areas where public water networks don’t reach. Members collectively own and manage the scheme to ensure a safe and reliable water supply.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>2. Who owns and operates KGWS?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The Killone Group Water Scheme is owned and operated by its members. An elected volunteer committee, chosen at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), oversees day-to-day running, finances, and long-term planning.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>3. How is the scheme funded?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Funding comes from water consumption fees for non-domestic members and organisations, government grant aiding for domestic connections up to 115 cubic metres annually, and 85% loans for major capital projects.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>4. Who can join the scheme?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Households, farms, or businesses within the service area can apply to join, provided there is capacity and the committee approves the application.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>5. What does the fees cover?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Your annual fee covers the cost of pumping and treating water, routine maintenance, insurance, administration, and investments in future upgrades to keep the service reliable. Some domestic connections use less than their annual allowance. As a group scheme we are strongly urging members to pay their fees using electronic funds transfer. See this under the 'Membership' tab. This is safe and provides two third party (your bank and our bank) independent verifications.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>6. How is water quality maintained?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Water is tested regularly by accredited laboratories to meet statutory standards. The committee monitors results closely and works with local authorities to ensure compliance and safety. These reports are published and downloable as a pdf under the 'Health&Safety' tab.The authorities routinely carry out their own testing as part of their statutory obligations. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>7. What should I do if there is a leak or supply issue?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>If you notice a leak or experience an interruption in your supply, please report it immediately using the emergency contact number provided under the 'Contact' tab (087 245 5253). Our maintenance contractors will respond as quickly as possible. If you realise that you have a leak on your side of the meter look under the 'Membership' tab and download our leaks policy document.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>8. Does the scheme use water meters?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>All connections are metered for billing and to encourage fair usage. We have embarked on a pilot project to allow us to take more frequent readings, thereby providing better leak detection. Monitoring your own water use can also help reduce costs and conserve this valuable resource.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>9. How can I conserve water?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Small changes make a big difference: fix dripping taps, use water-efficient appliances, harvest rainwater for gardening, and reduce hosepipe use whenever possible.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>10. What upgrades have been completed?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The scheme has continuously invested in its infrastructure and has been shown to be fairly resilient with respect to a major leak in Jan 2025. In 2005, a major pump house and delivery to the reservoir upgrade was funded through a government bundling scheme. This upgrade has been working well for 20 years.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>11. How are decisions made?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>All members have a say in how the scheme is run. Decisions are made democratically through the AGM and the elected committee. Members are encouraged to attend and participate.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>12. How are complaints handled?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>If you have a concern, you can raise it directly with the manager or the committee, who will work to resolve it fairly and transparently. See under the 'Contact' tab.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="accordion">
  <button>13. Who do I contact for emergencies or membership queries?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Contact information for the manager, including an emergency number, is provided under the 'Contact' tab  (087 245 5253). Application for membership can be initiated by downloading the application form under the 'Memebrship' tab.</p>
