<p>A Brief History of the Killone Group Water Scheme (KGWS)</p>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Killone Group Water Scheme (KGWS) has its roots in 1977, when a group of dedicated community members recognised the need for a safe and reliable water supply. The founding fathers and driving force behind the scheme were J. Nagle, F. Hogan, J. Mungovan, and J. J. Garvey, whose vision and commitment set the foundation for a transformative local project.<br><br>

Working together, they established KGWS as a friendly society and successfully applied for government funding to develop a modern water supply network. Over the next two years, infrastructure was constructed, including a reservoir and many kilometres of pipeline, ensuring households and farms across the region could access clean and dependable water.<br><br>

The scheme became fully operational by 1979, marked by its first Annual General Meeting (AGM). Since then, KGWS has operated continuously, serving as a lifeline for the community and adapting to evolving demands.<br><br>

In 2005, the scheme underwent a major upgrade with the construction of a modern pump house, supported by a government-backed bundling initiative, ensuring greater efficiency and long-term sustainability.<br><br>

Today, KGWS stands as a testament to community vision, collaboration, and perseveranceâ€”a legacy built on the dedication of its founders and sustained by generations of local support.</p>
