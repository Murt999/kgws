  <h1>Important information for members of the group water scheme</h1>
 
 <p>Billing 

The Scheme operates an annual billing system. 

Your service meter is read each year in December. Invoices are issued in January.Usage is calculated by deducting previous reading from current reading.If you have more than one meter installed the same procedure as above applies for all meters as each meter has a separate identification number.

If you qualify for a domestic allowance, the current domestic allowance is applied to each invoice. (Current domestic allowance is 110 cubic meters per year). The balance of your usage is then multiplied by the current water rate of â‚¬1.20 per cubic meter.

If there is a balance outstanding on your account it is brought forward to the current invoice..

Financial Difficulty

We are aware that at certain times in your life, circumstances can change. It happens to everybody. If you currently have financial difficulty in dealing with your account you can contact the manager in confidence and a payment plan will be arranged to suit your needs. We understand that there are many ways to approach this and we recognise that you are, in fact, a member of a friendly society. This was the way that KGWS was set up in 1979. </p>
